# Welcome to Bonfire
Bonfire provides you with a jump-start to your web-application development by providing you the framework, tools, and methodology you need to build a great product for your company or client. 

## Server Requirements
Bonfire requires the following server setup, at minimum:

* PHP version 5.4 or newer.
* SimpleXML enabled on your PHP installation for the docs to work.
* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) installed on development server.
* A Database. We currently use PDO/MySQL but try to keep it fairly flexible.

## Bonfire License Agreement
Multiple licenses apply to this application. 

* All **Bonfire-specific code** is licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which means you can do pretty much anything you want to with it, though hopefully ethics will still win the day here. 
* All **CodeIgniter-specific code** (anything within the `codeigniter` folder) is licensed by Ellis Labs under the [Open Software License 3.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/OSL-3.0). Basically means that any CodeIgniter code that you change must be made publicly available. Does not apply to your own code, just if you change their files. More details from their [blog](http://ellislab.com/blog/entry/software-license-wrap-up-and-osl-3.0).

## Credits
Obviously, [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com) and [EllisLab](http://www.ellislab.com/) are the heroes that brought this engine to the web so many years ago and inspired us with it's simplicity and elegance. True, it's got it's rough edges and might be aging a bit, but it works great and is solid code. 

[Lonnie Ezell](http://lonnieezell.com) wrote the initial version of Bonfire based on code and patterns on three fairly large projects he had done. Since they all shared fairly standard bits of code, he combined them into a nice package, wrote some docs, and released it to the world, figuring that someone might be able to get some use out of it. It became much more popular than he expected and landed him several new clients whom he has built a fairly lasting relationship with.

Bonfire also uses the following software packages:

* [Bootstrap CSS Framework](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [jQuery Javascript Framework](http://jquery.com/)
* [Eldarion AJAX Framework](https://github.com/eldarion/eldarion-ajax)
* [CSSMin](http://cssmin.googlecode.com/)
* [MrClay's Minify](https://github.com/mrclay/minify)
* [Plates PHP Template Engine](http://platesphp.com/)
